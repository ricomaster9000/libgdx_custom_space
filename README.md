Modified LibGDX for my game, focus on extension and small modification to retain ability to merge origin into this branch when new updates/changes are made.

I was growing tired&frustrated of going long ways to work around the framework to extend if for certain things, so this fork is for some of those changes/extension I really need to make that must exist on the lower framework level/layer.
